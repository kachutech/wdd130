    <p>Hi everyone!! I would like to take this opportunity to introduce myself. I live in Dar es salaam which is the capital city of my lovely country, Tanzania. I am married with four wonderful children. Our first son is now serving a mission in Ivory Coast while the other three are still in schools.I joned the church back in 1992 while in my second year of study at the university of Dar es salaam.</p>
    <p>I am a civil engineer by profession and so most of the time I work with "hardware" materials like concrete, steel, timber, rocks, soil etc. I have now decided to work with "software" as I plan to pursue a degree in software development. My dream is one day I will be able to provide an online program for teaching Mathematics and Science especially for the youth in rural areas.</p>
    <p>I know studying at old age is the challenging endeavor especially with other responsibilities related to work, family and church callings. However, I am highly encouraged by President Nelson's remarks related to this program. Said he, I encourage each person, regardless of age to continue to learn. Pursue whatever path will be most valuable to you and your family. You will be blessed as you do this.</p>
    <p>It is my hope and prayer that we will work together in helping each other achieve our individual goals in strengthening our families and Zion. </p>
